        <p><b>Lesson 3: Introduction to Loops and arrays</b></p>

        <p id="LessonPlan">
            Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python Lists can be used instead. 
            Arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable 
            This lesson shows you how to use LISTS as ARRAYS, however, to work with arrays in Python you will have to
            import a library, like the NumPy library. 
            An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index
            number.

            Array indexes start with 0: [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element, etc.

            To find out how many elements an array has, use the length property "len(arrayName)""
            You can use the append() method to add an element to an array. 
            You can use the pop() method to remove an element from the array. 
            You can also use the remove() method to remove an element from the array. 


        </p>

        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>
#Create Array
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]

#Change Ford to Opel
cars[0] = "Opel"

lengthOfArray = len(cars)

#Add Honda to the end of the array and remove Volvo from the array
cars.append("Honda") 
cars.remove("Volvo") 
            </pre>
        </div>

        <p>Loops</p>

        <p id="LessonPlan">
            In programming there are two main kinds of loops. A for loop and a while loop. A while loop will first check
            condition and if it's true
            then run the code inside of it. Once it reaches the end it will check the condition again, loops can run
            infinitely so make sure it's able to
            exit when intended. For loops do the same steps except in python they are designed explicitly for iteration.
            Iterating through a list of values for example.
        </p>

        <p id="LessonPlan">
            Here is an example of both a while and a for loop:
        </p>

        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>
whileIndex = 0

while (whileIndex != 10):
    whileIndex =+ 1
    print("Hello")

ListOfNames = ["Jack", "John", "Ron"]

for (index in ListOfNames):
    print(index)
                </pre>
        </div>

        <p id="LessonPlan">
            In the while loop the text Hello is printed 10 times. In the for loop each named is printed one after
            another starting with "Jack"
        </p>

        <p id="LessonPlan">
            Loops are powerful tools for creating code that can go through each possible iteration easily.
        </p>
