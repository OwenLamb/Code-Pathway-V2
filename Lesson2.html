        <p><b>Lesson 2: Introduction to Conditional Statements and Data types</b></p>

        <p id="LessonPlan">
            In programming, data type is an important concept.
            Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

            Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:
            Text Type: str
            Numeric Types: int, float, complex
            Sequence Types: list, tuple, range
            Mapping Type: dict
            Set Types: set, frozenset
            Boolean Type: bool
            Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview

            In Python, it automatically selects the data type for you without the need to declare which type you want. 
            In some instances however you may want to set the data type different than what the default type is. 
            The data type is set when you assign a value to a variable
            You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function
            If you want to specify the data type, you can use the following constructor functions

            There are three numeric types in Python:
            int - Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
            float - Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more
            decimals.
            complex - Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part
            Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.

            You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods

        <p><b>Conditional statements</b></p>

        <p id="LessonPlan">
            Conditional statements let you execute specific code based on certain conditions, adding
            dynamic behavior to your scripts.
            They allow your code to make decisions and respond differently depending on the situation.
            The basic structure in Python is an if statement, which checks whether a condition is True or False.
        </p>

        <p id="LessonPlan">
            Here is an example:
        </p>

        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>
#This is set to a boolean type
state = True

if state == True:
    print("Hello World")
else:
    print("No dice")
                </pre>
        </div>

        <p id="LessonPlan">
            In this code:
        </p>
        <ul id="LessonPlan">
            <li>state is a boolean variable, which can be either True or False.</li>
            <li>The if statement checks if state is True. If it is, the code inside the if block executes, printing
                "Hello World".</li>
            <li>If state is False, the code inside the else block runs, printing "No dice".</li>
        </ul>

        <p id="LessonPlan">
            You can use different conditions other than == (equals). There are <= less than or equal to,> greater than,
                etc. You can also add additional
                conditions with elif (short for "else if"), which checks another condition if the first one isn’t met.
                Here’s an example:
        </p>

        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>
state = False
alternate_state = True

if state == True:
    print("Hello World")
elif alternate_state == True:
    print("Hello Universe")
else:
    print("No dice")
            </pre>
        </div>

        <p id="LessonPlan">In this example:</p>
        <ul id="LessonPlan">
            <li>If state is True, it prints "Hello World".</li>
            <li>If state is False but alternate_state is True, it prints "Hello Universe".</li>
            <li>If both state and alternate_state are False, it prints "No dice".</li>
        </ul>

        <p id="LessonPlan">
            Conditional statements are powerful tools for creating flexible and responsive code.
