        <p><b>Lesson 4: Introduction to Functions and Classes</b></p>

        <p id="LessonPlan">
            A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
            You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
            A function can return data as a result.
            In Python a function is defined using the def keyword: </p>

        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>
def my_function(): 
    print("Hello from a function") 
                </pre>
        </div>

        <p id="LessonPlan">
        To call a function in Python, write the function's name followed by two parentheses () </p>
        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>
def my_function():
    print("Hello from a function")
          
my_function()
                </pre>
        </div>

        <p id="LessonPlan">
        The terms parameter and argument can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function.
        From a function's perspective:
        A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
        An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called. </p>

        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>
def my_function(fname):
    print(fname)

#prints each name to the console
my_function("Emily")
my_function("Tobias")
my_function("Linus")
                </pre>
        </div>

        <p id="LessonPlan">
        By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments.
        Meaning that if your function expects 2 arguments,
        you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more, and not less.</p>
        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>
def my_function(fname, lname):
    print(fname + " " + lname)

my_function("Emil", "Refsnes")
                </pre>
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
            Classes
        </p>

        <p id="LessonPlan">
            Python is an object oriented programming language.
            Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
            A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

            Create a Class
            To create a class, use the keyword class </p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>
class MyClass:
    x = 5
                    </pre>
            </div>
            <p id="LessonPlan">
            Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>
p1 = MyClass()
    print(p1.x)    
                    </pre>
            </div>
            <p id="LessonPlan"> 
            The __init__() Function
            The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life
            applications.
            To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.
            All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
            Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to
            do when the object is being created </p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

    p1 = Person("John", 36)

    print(p1.name)
    print(p1.age)    
                    </pre>
            </div>
            <p id="LessonPlan">
            The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that
            belong to the class.
            It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter
            of any function in the class
            Since python is an object oriented language, we can have properties of OOPs like Polymorphism, Inheritance,
            Encapsulation and Abstraction similar to other programming languages.
            Scope of variables is also same as that of other languages.
        </p>

        <p><b>Lesson Quiz</b></p>
        <p id="LessonPlan">Create a Python class called Employee that stores the following information for each employee: name, age, and job position. 
            Use the employee data provided below to create instances of the Employee class and store them in a list. Next, write a function called print_employee_names 
            that takes the list of employees as an argument and prints each employee's name to the console. See below for given employee data:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>
Sarah, 36, Engineer
John, 42, Accountant
Bob, 53, Cashier
                </pre>
        </div>

        <textarea id="UserCode">type here</textarea>
        <button id="Submit">Submit</button>
