            <p>Lesson 1 Introduction to Python</p>
            <p id="LessonPlan">    Python is one of the most used programming languages currently in the world. 
                It is one of the best languages for beginners because of how easy and forgiving the language 
                is. The reason being is that Python includes a comprehensive library installed with the language. 
                One of pythons greatest strengths is a wide array of libraries it has at its disposale. This 
                allows users to who don't have the expertise or time to program specific functions or classes to 
                seamlessly plug in functionality into their code. But we're getting ahead of ourselves so lets 
                start at the beginning.

            <p>Python Indentation</p>
            <p id="LessonPlan">Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. 
            Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. 
            Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code. 
            Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation 
            The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one. 
            You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error
            </p>

            <p>Comments</p>
            <p id="LessonPlan">Comments can be used to explain Python code.
            Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
            Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
            Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them 
            Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments. 
            To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line  
            Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string. 
            Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it 
            As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.

            <p>Hello World</p>
            <p id="LessonPlan">   Every programmer when they learn a new language does one line of code first. 
                That line is printing to the console "Hello World". To do that in python you simply type:
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>
print("Hello World")
                </pre>
                </div>


            <p>Lesson Quiz</p>
            <p id="LessonPlan">Can you print out Hello World twice to the console? Example output below</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>
Hello World
Hello World
                </pre>
                </div>
            <textarea id="UserCode">type here</textarea>
            <button id="Submit">Submit</button>
